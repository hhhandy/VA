Introduction\r\nThe city of Engagement, Ohio USA is anticipating future rapid growth\r\nby doing a participatory urban planning survey with 1011 representative\r\nresidents. City planning team is to make sense of data provided to\r\nunderstand the current state of the city.\r\nThis project aims to provide an interactive web-enabled\r\nvisualizations to allow users to identify and visualize the\r\nlife patterns in the city in a single dashboard. Users\r\nwill be able to see where the facilities are located, the busiest areas\r\nand traffic bottlenecks within the city and how the daily routines\r\ndiffer between two selected participants.\r\nThe application is built to integrate techniques from data analytics\r\nand data visualizations by using R shiny.\r\n2. Data Description\r\nDatasets were obtained from the VAST Challenge\r\n2022 official website in csv format. They contain\r\ninformation of the participants as well as the facilities located within\r\nthe city.\r\n3. Methodology\r\nThe steps required in this project are as follows.\r\nData wrangling: To perform basic function such as\r\njoining datasets and filtering, to convert datasets into a format that\r\ncan be read by R packages and to reduce the file size.\r\nDescriptive analysis: Use appropriate static and\r\ninteractive statistical graphs to show the patterns of life within the\r\ncity.\r\nDashboarding: To compile all the graphs into an\r\ninteractive dashboard.\r\nThe following are R packages required to perform the analysis and\r\ncreate the dashboard.\r\n\r\nPackages\r\nPurpose\r\nshiny, shinydashboard & shinywidgets\r\nTo build interactive web application and visualizations\r\nshinythemes\r\nTo select beautiful shiny themes\r\ntidyverse\r\nTo support basic data manipulation\r\nsf\r\nTo handle geospatial data in wkt format\r\nsftime\r\nTo store and handle spatiotemporal data\r\ntmap\r\nTo visualize movement data\r\nlubridate\r\nTo manipulate date-time object\r\nclock\r\nTo manipulate date-time object\r\nanytime\r\nTo convert timestamp into parsed datetime\r\nViSiElse\r\nTo visualize daily routines\r\nggstatsplot\r\nTo provide statistical analysis and graphs\r\nplotly & ggiraph\r\nTo create interactive graphs\r\nDT\r\nTo create interactive data table\r\ndata.table\r\nTo support aggegation of large datasets\r\nrmarkdown\r\nTo convert R markdown into desired format\r\nggthemes\r\nTo beautify statistical graphs\r\n\r\n4. Storyboard\r\n4.1 City Area Characterization\r\nProblem Statement\r\nAssuming the volunteers are representative of the city’s population,\r\ncharacterize the distinct areas of the city that you identify. For each\r\narea you identify, provide your rationale and supporting data.\r\nVisualization\r\nThis visualization divides the city into four regions and shows the\r\noutline of the different buildings as well as the location of different\r\nfacilities (Apartments, Pubs, Restaurants and Schools).\r\nAnother visualization shows how the demographic attributes of the\r\nparticipants affect the location that they reside at.\r\n4.2 Traffic Bottlenecks\r\nProblem Statement\r\nWhere are the busiest areas in Engagement? Are there traffic\r\nbottlenecks that should be addressed? Explain your rationale.\r\nVisualization\r\nThis visualization will find out peak periods of high traffic at\r\nvarious locations in the city by counting the footfall of participants\r\nat various participants across the day in the form of calendar heat map.\r\nAdditional segregation to be done to visualize the difference between\r\nweekdays and weekends.\r\nFurthermore, another visualization is plotted to show the traffic\r\ndensity heatmap of the various locations in the city via hexagon\r\nmapping, with toggles on the Time (binned), Month and Weekday/Weekend to\r\nshowcase the difference in the traffic bottlenecks.\r\n4.3 Daily Routines of\r\nParticipants\r\nProblem Statement\r\nParticipants have given permission to have their daily routines\r\ncaptured. Choose two different participants with different routines and\r\ndescribe their daily patterns, with supporting evidence.\r\nVisualization\r\nThis visualization shows the participant profiles, followed by daily\r\nactivities of two selected participants. It tells the audience how their\r\nweekdays and weekends routines vary across different months.\r\nClick here to\r\nexplore the app!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
