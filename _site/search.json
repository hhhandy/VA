Project Overview\r\nThis project will be based on VAST Challenge\r\n2022. The city of Engagement, Ohio USA is anticipating\r\nfuture rapid growth by doing a participatory urban planning survey. A\r\ntotal of 1011 representative residents have agreed to provide their data\r\nusing the urban planning app, such as the places they visit and their\r\nfinancial journal.\r\nOut of 3 challenges in VAST Challenge 2022, we decided to select\r\nChallenge 2: Patterns of Life. In this challenge, we\r\nwill reveal the patterns of daily life throughout the city.\r\nSpecifically, we will characterize the distinct areas within the city,\r\nidentify the potential traffic bottlenecks, describe the daily routines\r\nfor selected participants and examine how patterns change over time.\r\n2. Data Source\r\nDatasets were obtained from the VAST Challenge 2022 official website\r\nin csv format. Datasets required for this challenge are including, but\r\nnot limited to:\r\nParticipantStatusLogs(n).csv\r\nBuildings.csv\r\nParticipants.csv\r\nPubs.csv\r\nRestaurants.csv\r\nCheckinJournal.csv\r\nData processing will be further explained in the next section\r\nbelow.\r\n3. Methodology\r\nThe following are the packages required for this challenge, including\r\nbut not limited to:\r\ntidyverse: to support data science including data\r\nmanipulation and static statistical graphs creation\r\nsf: to handle geospatial data in wkt format\r\ntmap: to visualize movement data\r\nlubridate: to manipulate date-time object\r\nclock: to manipulate date-time object\r\nViSiElse: to visualize daily routines\r\ngganimate: to create animated statistical graphs\r\nfor time-series analysis\r\nggstatsplot: to provide statistical details\r\n4. Proposed Visualization\r\n4.1 City Area Characterization\r\nProblem Statement\r\nAssuming the volunteers are representative of the city’s population,\r\ncharacterize the distinct areas of the city that you identify. For each\r\narea you identify, provide your rationale and supporting data. Limit\r\nyour response to 10 images and 500 words.\r\nVisualization\r\n1: Building Composite Map for Facilities Location\r\nIntent and Implementation\r\nThe intent of this visualization is to show the outline of the\r\ndifferent buildings as well as the location of different facilities\r\n(Apartments, Pubs, Restaurants, Schools, and Employers). The different\r\nfacility types will be depicted by different colour dots. As for the\r\nbase building outlines, it will be depicted by two colours based on the\r\nbuilding type (either commercial or residential). To ensure ease of use,\r\nand to prevent the visualization from being too cluttered, check boxes\r\nwill be used to allow for the selection of facility types to be\r\nshown.\r\nData Processing\r\nThe Apartment, Pubs, Restaurant, Schools, and Employer data files are\r\nto be merged into a single file with only the facility type and building\r\nnumber retained. This will aid in the minimizing of the data file\r\nsize.\r\nExample of Visualization\r\n\r\nAnticipated\r\nProblems and Areas for Improvements\r\nVisualization may be too cluttered to bring sufficient insights and\r\nvalue. As there are many employer locations, including them may fail to\r\nyield good insights. This can be reconsidered after testing out the\r\nvisualization.\r\nVisualization\r\n2: Building Composite Map for Participants – Filtered by Demographic\r\nParameters\r\nIntent and Implementation\r\nThe intent of this visualization is to study how the demographic\r\nattributes of the participants affect the location that they reside at.\r\nTo enable this a building composite map visualization will be built with\r\nthe demographic attributes present as filters on the R Shiny\r\napplication. To allow for comparison, two sets of filters will be show,\r\nwith the output of the first filter being shown by blue dots and the\r\nsecond filter being shown by red dots. Filters used will be: • Household\r\nSize (Drop down list) • Number of Kids (Drop down list) • Education\r\nLevel (Drop down list) • Interest Group (Drop down list) • Age (Scroll\r\nbar with start and end selection) • Joviality (Scroll bar with start and\r\nend selection)\r\nData Processing\r\nThe Participant dataset will be used for this visualization. No\r\nfurther processing of the dataset is needed.\r\nExample of Visualization\r\n\r\nAnticipated\r\nProblems and Areas for Improvements\r\nAt this juncture it is not clear if a having both plots on a single\r\ngraph would be best option. Alternatively, we could explore having two\r\nplots with their own filters.\r\nVisualization\r\n3: Hexagonal Binning Map for Residential Occupancy Rate\r\nIntent and Implementation\r\nThe intent of this visualization is to show if certain areas of the\r\ncity is more desirable to the participants over other areas. This will\r\nbe done by using the computed occupancy rate of buildings as the event\r\npoints in the hexagons. Occupancy rate can be calculated for different\r\nmonths of the observation period to see if there are any noticeable\r\nchanges in area occupancy rate over time.\r\nData Processing\r\nA snapshot of the participants apartment Id will be taken for the\r\nstart of every month from the ParticipantStatusLogs. The apartment Id\r\nwill then be matched with the corresponding building Id using the\r\nApartments dataset. The Apartment dataset will also be used to compute\r\nthe max occupancy limit for apartments in each building. The total count\r\nof participants residing in a building divided by the max residential\r\noccupancy of the building will give us the residential occupancy rate of\r\nthe building.\r\nExample of Visualization\r\n\r\nAnticipated\r\nProblems and Areas for Improvements\r\nA possible area for improvement could be to animate the changes in\r\noccupancy rate over the different months to showcase the difference.\r\nVisualization\r\n4: Hexagonal Binning Map for Cost of Rental and Facilities\r\nIntent and Implementation\r\nThis visualization aims to show how cost of rental and other\r\nfacilities differ across the city. Two hexagonal binning maps will be\r\ndisplayed next to each other. The visualization on the left will use the\r\naverage rental cost per occupant per building as the event points. The\r\nsecond visualization on the right will show the facilities with their\r\nassociated costs as the event points (e.g. For Restaurants, foodCost\r\nwill be used). A radio button will list the different choice of\r\nfacilities to display, namely Schools, Restaurants and Pubs. A skeletal\r\ngrey outline of the hexes representing the different blocks will be\r\nbeneficial for the user to identify the location of the facilities.\r\nData Processing\r\nFirstly, the additional data that is not required all the datasets\r\n(Apartments, Schools, Restaurants and Pubs) will be dropped to reduce\r\nfile size. Following this, the average cost associated with each\r\nbuilding will be computed using group by function. The Apartment dataset\r\nwill be used to compute the average per occupant rental cost for each\r\nbuilding.\r\nExample of Visualization\r\n\r\nAnticipated\r\nProblems and Areas for Improvements\r\nWe could consider linking up both visualization such that hovering\r\nover one hex would highlight the same hex in the second visualization\r\n(by fading out the other hexes in the plot)\r\n4.2 Traffic Bottlenecks\r\nProblem Statement\r\nWhere are the busiest areas in Engagement? Are there traffic\r\nbottlenecks that should be addressed? Explain your rationale. Limit your\r\nresponse to 10 images and 500 words.\r\nVisualization\r\n1: Histogram for Participants’ Count in Locations over Time\r\nIntent and Implementation\r\nThe intent of this visualization is to find out peak periods of high\r\ntraffic at various locations in the city by counting the footfall of\r\nparticipants at various participants across the day in the form of\r\nhistogram. Additional segregation to be done to visualize the difference\r\nbetween weekdays and weekends. With a dropdown box for Location\r\nselection, a main histogram of the traffic density across the 24 hours\r\nwill be charted, along with the desired Month to be selected via another\r\ndropdown box. Another set of charts (facets of weekdays and weekends)\r\nthat are linked to the same Location and Month selection, would also be\r\nplotted to allow visualization of the traffic histogram across the days\r\nof the week.\r\nData Processing\r\nTo optimize memory load, only the participants’ location data will be\r\nextracted (hourly snapshot) from the multiple ParticpantsStatusLog (72\r\nof them) data files and merged into a single file.\r\nExample of Visualization\r\n\r\nAnticipated\r\nProblems and Areas for Improvements\r\nThe amount of data is expected to be huge even with selective\r\nextraction/cleaning at the start. We will optimize again if it becomes\r\ntoo cumbersome to produce the charts. We are expecting to see certain\r\npeak hours across the weekdays and weekends, from there we will be able\r\nto narrow down these key interest time periods for our subsequent\r\nanalysis in this traffic bottleneck problem. To reduce the number of\r\nlocations, we could bin the locations into different areas/segments of\r\nthe city. A map could be used to show the user the different location\r\nbins. Alternatively, we could use user selection to generate an\r\ninteractive data table from which the histogram is shown.\r\nVisualization\r\n2: Hexagon Binning Map for Traffic Density over Time\r\nIntent and Implementation\r\nThe intent of this is to visualization is to plot the traffic density\r\nheatmap of the various locations in the city via hexagon mapping, with\r\ntoggles on the Time (binned), Month and Weekday/Weekend to showcase the\r\ndifference in the traffic bottlenecks. With a dropdown box for Location\r\nselection, a main histogram of the traffic density across the 24 hours\r\nwill be charted, along with the desired Month to be selected via another\r\ndropdown box. Another set of charts (facets of weekdays and weekends)\r\nthat are linked to the same Location and Month selection, would also be\r\nplotted to allow visualization of the traffic histogram across the days\r\nof the week.\r\nData Processing\r\nThe participants’ location data will be extracted (hourly snapshot)\r\nfrom the multiple ParticpantsStatusLog (72 of them) data files and\r\nmerged into a single file. The dataset will then be binned into certain\r\ntime periods to optimize memory load for charting. Having said that, we\r\nmay try to allow for timing selection (slider) to alter the hexagon\r\nmapping chart accordingly.\r\nExample of Visualization\r\n\r\nAnticipated\r\nProblems and Areas for Improvements\r\nThe amount of data is expected to be huge even with selective\r\nextraction/cleaning at the start. We will optimize again if it becomes\r\ntoo cumbersome to produce the charts. We are expecting to see certain\r\npeak hours across the weekdays and weekends, from there we will be able\r\nto narrow down these key interest time periods for our subsequent\r\nanalysis in this traffic bottleneck problem.\r\n4.3 Daily Routines of\r\nParticipants\r\nProblem Statement\r\nParticipants have given permission to have their daily routines\r\ncaptured. Choose two different participants with different routines and\r\ndescribe their daily patterns, with supporting evidence. Limit your\r\nresponse to 10 images and 500 words.\r\nVisualization 1:\r\nDaily Routine by ViSiElse\r\nIntent and Implementation\r\nThis visualization will show daily activities of two selected\r\nparticipants. Using demographic variables, day, and month filtering\r\noptions, this will tell the audience how their weekdays and weekends\r\nroutines vary across different months. For example, we will compare\r\nSunday activities of the happiest participant against the unhappiest\r\nparticipant in December 2022.\r\nData Processing\r\nWe will be using a new joined dataset derived from 72\r\nParticipantsStatusLog datasets for daily activities. Using demographic\r\nvariables such as joviality, we will select two participants that are at\r\nthe extreme ends. Next, we will filter these two participant IDs and\r\nsave it as a new dataset.\r\nExample of Visualization\r\n\r\nAnticipated\r\nProblems and Areas for Improvements\r\nData preparation to fit ViSiElse requirement and data exploration to\r\nselect two distinct participants. Further study is to check if we are\r\nable to make ViSiElse visualization interactive, which possibly leads to\r\nother visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
